# Recommended VS Code Extensions

This guide provides a list of recommended Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to enhance your development experience with the Py Launch Blueprint project.

## Recommended Extensions

Here are the recommended VS Code extensions for this project:

1. **Python** (`ms-python.python`)
   - Provides rich support for the Python language, including features such as IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and more.

2. **Pylance** (`ms-python.vscode-pylance`)
   - A performant, feature-rich language server for Python, providing fast, feature-rich language support.

3. **Ruff** (`charliermarsh.ruff`)
   - A fast and efficient linter and formatter for Python code.

4. **Even Better TOML** (`tamasfe.even-better-toml`)
   - Provides syntax highlighting, formatting, and validation for TOML files.

5. **YAML** (`redhat.vscode-yaml`)
   - Provides comprehensive YAML language support to VS Code, including validation, autocompletion, and hover support.

6. **GitLens** (`eamodio.gitlens`)
   - Enhances the built-in Git capabilities of VS Code, providing features such as blame annotations, code lens, and more.

7. **Code Spell Checker** (`streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker`)
   - A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code.

> **Note:** command-line type checking is handled by [ty](ty.md) (`just typecheck`); in the editor, Pylance provides the equivalent real-time feedback, so no separate type-checker extension is needed.

## Installing Extensions

To install these extensions, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for each extension by name and click the Install button.

Alternatively, you can install extensions from the command line using the `code` command:

```bash
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension ms-python.vscode-pylance
code --install-extension charliermarsh.ruff
code --install-extension tamasfe.even-better-toml
code --install-extension redhat.vscode-yaml
code --install-extension eamodio.gitlens
code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
```
