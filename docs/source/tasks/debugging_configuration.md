# Debugging Configuration Guide

This guide helps you set up and run debugging sessions across common editors.

## General Debugging Steps

1. Open your project folder in your editor.
2. Open the Debug panel:

   * VS Code: Use the **Run & Debug** tab.
   * Cursor: Search for "Debug: Select and Start Debugging".
   * Windsurf: Use the debug view.
3. Choose a configuration:

   * `Python: Launch Main`
   * `Python: Launch Main (With Args)`
4. Add breakpoints by clicking to the left of line numbers.
5. Start the debugger.

## VS Code

VS Code uses the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

### Launching

Open the **Run & Debug** panel and select one of the configurations:

```json
"configurations": [
  {
    "name": "Python: Launch Main",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/py_launch_blueprint/cli/main.py"
  },
  {
    "name": "Python: Launch Main (With Args)",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/py_launch_blueprint/cli/main.py",
    "args": ["projects", "list", "--workspace", "test", "--limit", "10"]
  }
]
```

Set breakpoints and start debugging using the green ▶️ button or `F5`.
