"""Thin Textual interview shell for the template-press post-init concierge.

This is the bounded "first deliverable" from design 0005: an interview that
collects the four real decisions and emits the same JSON the CLI/JSON
(agent) frontend would consume — proving the frontend↔core seam before the
dashboard/board and errand cards exist.

All decision logic lives in decisions.py (pure, dep-free, tested). This
file is only the terminal shell. Run interactively:

    ./interview.py            # or: uv run --script interview.py

Or smoke-test headlessly (no TTY, prints the resolved decisions as JSON):

    ./interview.py --demo
